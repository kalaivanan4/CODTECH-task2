OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

project:Create a simple vulnerability scanning tool that scans a network or website for common security vulnerabilities such as open ports, outdated software versions, and misconfigurations.

objective:
Here's a high-level overview of how to create a simple vulnerability scanning tool that scans a network or website for common security vulnerabilities such as open ports, outdated software versions, and misconfigurations:

Tool Requirements
Programming language: Python or any other language of your choice
Libraries and frameworks: Scapy, Nmap, or other libraries for network scanning and vulnerability detection

Database: SQLite or any other database to store scan results
Tool Components

Network Scanner: A module that uses Scapy or Nmap to scan the network or website for open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.
Vulnerability Database: A database that stores information about known vulnerabilities, including CVE IDs, descriptions, and affected software versions.

Scan Engine: A module that uses the network scanner and vulnerability database to identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

Report Generator: A module that generates a report of the scan results, including identified vulnerabilities, severity levels, and recommendations for remediation.
Network Scanner Module

Import required libraries: Import Scapy or Nmap libraries for network scanning.

Define scan parameters: Define scan parameters, including IP address range, port range, and scan type (e.g., TCP, UDP).

Perform network scan: Perform the network scan using Scapy or Nmap.

Parse scan results: Parse the scan results to extract information about open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.
Vulnerability Database Module

Create a database: Create a database to store information about known vulnerabilities.

Populate the database: Populate the database with information about known vulnerabilities, including CVE IDs, descriptions, and affected software versions.

Query the database: Query the database to retrieve information about potential vulnerabilities identified during the scan.
Scan Engine Module

Use the network scanner: Use the network scanner module to scan the network or website.
Query the vulnerability database: Query the vulnerability database to retrieve information about potential vulnerabilities identified during the scan.

Identify vulnerabilities: Identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations based on the scan results and vulnerability database.
Assign severity levels: Assign severity levels to identified vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and likelihood of exploitation.
Report Generator Module

Generate a report: Generate a report of the scan results, including identified vulnerabilities, severity levels, and recommendations for remediation.
Include detailed information: Include detailed information about each identified vulnerability, including CVE ID, description, and affected software versions.
Provide remediation recommendations: Provide recommendations for remediation, including patching, configuration changes, and security best practices.
